### Reasoning
Router web server problem is similar to Autocomplete with Tries, with hte difference being that charecter in later is replaced by words in the path of former. The order of complexity is dependenat on the address of the path. Consider total number of nodes to be $n$. Time and space complexity are give below.

### complexity analysis
1. Time complexity is $O(n)$
2. Space Complexity is $O(n)$

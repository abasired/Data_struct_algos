### Reasoning
We solve this problem using an idea similar to bubble sort algorithm, as it involves less number of unique numbers to compare. We loop over the list of unique numbers in the array to obtain sorted array. We maintain two indices to scan through the array and adjust values based on respective comparison. 

### complexity analysis
1. Time complexity is $O(n)$
2. Space Complexity is $O(1)$

### Reasoning
This problem can be categorized as a traditional sorting problem followed by appropriate operations. We initially sort input list and alternatively pick numbers to obtain required solution.In this case we choose to implement merge-sort algorithm as it has the least worst case time complexity among sorting algorithms. Further, as the input list can be only from $[0,9]$, space complexity is also low comparatively.   


### complexity analysis
1. Time complexity is $O(n\log(n))$
2. Space Complexity is $O(n)$

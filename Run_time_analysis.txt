Consider $m$ and $n$ as the number of entries in texts and calls CSV respectively.

### Task0.py:
In this program we read data from CSV and print it few elements of a list.
* Time complexity is O(1) 
 

### Task1.py:
In this program, we list out the total number of unique numbers.
* Time complexity is O(n+m)


### Task2.py:
In this task, we compute time spent by each number in call list and store it in a dictionary. Later we compute max value and respective key of the generated dictionary.
* Time complexity is O(n)

### Task3.py:
* As we are sorting a set in this code, Time complexity is O(nlog(n)) ($O(n\log(n))$ in latex)

### Task4.py:
we scan through the outgoing calls and add telemarketers to the set. 
* As sorting is involved, Time complexity is O(nlog(n)) ($O(n\log(n))$ in latex)

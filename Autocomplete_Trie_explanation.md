### Reasoning
Implementation of Autocomplete with Tries is self explanatory from the notebook. The order of complexity seems to be dependent on the total number of nodes in the Trie. Consider total number of nodes to be $n$. Time and space complexity are give below.

### complexity analysis
1. Time complexity is $O(n)$
2. Space Complexity is $O(n)$
